# MCP Salesforce Revenue Cloud

## Overview

MCP Salesforce Revenue Cloud is a Python-based project designed to interact with Salesforce Revenue Cloud. It appears to leverage the Salesforce API for operations related to revenue management and potentially integrates with Google's Gemini AI for advanced data processing, insights, or automation tasks.

This project aims to automate quote-to-cash processes.

## Features

*   **Salesforce Revenue Cloud Integration**: Connects to Salesforce to perform operations related to [**e.g., Quotes, Orders, Subscriptions, Billings, etc.**].
*   **Google Gemini AI Integration**: Potentially uses Google's AI capabilities for [**e.g., data analysis, report generation, intelligent recommendations, etc.**].
*   **API-Driven**: Utilizes Salesforce REST APIs for robust and secure communication.
*   **Configurable**: Environment-specific settings are managed through a `.env` file.

[**Add more specific features as your project develops.**]

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   Python (3.8+ recommended)
*   Access to a Salesforce instance with API enabled.
*   A Salesforce Connected App set up with the necessary permissions for API access. You will need its Client ID and Client Secret.
*   Your Salesforce username, password, and security token.
*   A Google AI Studio API Key for Gemini functionalities.
*   `pip` for installing Python packages.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bittersea1803/mcp_salesforce_revenue_cloud.git
    cd mcp_salesforce_revenue_cloud
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    (Assuming you have a `requirements.txt` file. If not, create one and list your dependencies like `simple-salesforce`, `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv` etc.)
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist yet, you might need to install common libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install python-dotenv simple-salesforce google-generativeai
    ```
    *(You'll need to create `requirements.txt` based on your actual project dependencies.)*

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file `.env.example` (if you create one) or create a new file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. Populate it with your credentials as shown in the Configuration section below.
    ```
    cp .env.example .env  # If .env.example exists
    # or create .env manually
    ```

## Configuration

The project uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive credentials and environment-specific settings. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```properties
# .env - Environment variables

# Google AI Studio API Key for Gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY"

# Salesforce Connected App credentials for API access
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_SALESFORCE_CONNECTED_APP_CLIENT_ID"
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_SALESFORCE_CONNECTED_APP_CLIENT_SECRET"
SALESFORCE_USERNAME="YOUR_SALESFORCE_USERNAME"
SALESFORCE_PASSWORD="YOUR_SALESFORCE_PASSWORD_AND_SECURITY_TOKEN" # Concatenate password and security token
SALESFORCE_DOMAIN="https://your-domain.my.salesforce.com" # e.g., https://login.salesforce.com for production, or https://test.salesforce.com for a sandbox
```

**Important Notes on Configuration:**

*   `SALESFORCE_PASSWORD`: This should be your Salesforce password immediately followed by your Salesforce security token (without any spaces). If your organization uses IP whitelisting and your current IP is whitelisted, the security token might not be required.
*   `SALESFORCE_DOMAIN`:
    *   For production or developer orgs: `https://login.salesforce.com`
    *   For sandbox orgs: `https://test.salesforce.com`
    *   For custom domains: `https://your-custom-domain.my.salesforce.com`
*   Ensure the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive credentials to your repository.

## Usage

[**Provide instructions on how to run your application or scripts. For example:**]

```bash
python main.py [arguments]
```

Or describe the main entry point and any key functionalities.

```python
# Example: main.py
# from dotenv import load_dotenv
# import os

# load_dotenv()

# google_api_key = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
# sf_client_id = os.getenv("SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID")

# # ... your project logic here
```
